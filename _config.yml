    Hi, I'm Jungbin Son, a machine learning engineer specializing in <mark>natural language processing</mark> and <mark>computer vision</mark>.
    I focus on developing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for understanding document images and extracting structured information like key-value pairs and tables.

    My work spans from designing models that combine vision and text to deploying them efficiently using VLLM-based inference frameworks.
    I'm especially interested in document language modeling, OCR integration, and scalable model serving for real-world applications.

            - We addressed the problem that QA models could not understand time by 
            training with a new task and synthetic data. The model trained with Time-Context 
            dependent Span Extraction (TCSE) outperforms baseline models up to 8.5 of the F1-score in the TimeQA dataset.

             The proposed method achieved 380 times faster runtime than previous deduplication algorithms, and it achieved 4% accuracy improvement.

          I conducted research on **time-sensitive question answering**, which is one of the most challenging tasks for state-of-the-art language models. 
          I proposed data generation techniques suitable for this task and modeling methods using contrastive learning.
